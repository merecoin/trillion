Attention!!! After we learned about the discovery of scientists hat there are 2 different biological species of people - we decided that now we will give out Trillion coins to individuals of our species. And here are the distinctive features of our biological species:

- We are intelligent (IQ over 120)
- We empathize with other living beings
- We strive for universal harmony and order based on reasonableness

If this is about you - welcome to the project! Get your free Trillion coins in our Airdrop! ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3747251 )

Trillion
========

As you know, in the 30s of the 20th century, a global crisis occurred in the world, also known as the "Great Depression". It happened because of the banal lack of money. There were a lot of goods, but little money from people. Producers could not sell their goods, because people had nothing to buy them.

Now the same situation is observed with Bitcoin: 22 million coins - this is very small for our planet. Bitcoin at all is not enough. And they are difficult to mine. And so we created Trillion. The maximum number of coins in the Trillion system is comparable to the world's stock of cash dollars:

13,000,000,000,000 (thirteen trillion)
--------------------------------------

Moreover, we made a premine of the coins to give each person 1,000,000 coins!!! Free!

Our goal: a million millionaires. In the United States there are a million millionaires. Therefore, the US is such a rich and great country. And when we give a million people a million coins to each - Trillion will be as great a coin as the US Dollar.

Trillion is a Bitcoin clone. Same simple and reliable. Trillion can be mined on your work or home computer, directly in the wallet-program ( https://github.com/merecoin/trillion/releases ).

- Maximum number of coins: 13,000,000,000,000 TRLN
- Block reward: 4,000,000 TRLN

The number of coins that you can independently mine: 6,720,000,000,000 TRLN - the rest we will distribute among people who do not have the necessary computing power.

Primary Bounty-program provides distribution to one million people for one million coins each. The task is ambitious, but I hope, we will cope. Immediately a convincing request: which of you will get a million coins - share with friends, do not be greedy, because the more you give - the more you will return. And this is not a religion at all, it's a banal mechanics of crypto-currency functioning.
